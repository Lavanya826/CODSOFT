🎬 Movie Rating Prediction with Machine Learning
📌 Project Description

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft.
The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like:

Genre

Director

Actors

The project uses Python and Machine Learning regression techniques to analyze historical movie data and estimate movie ratings.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about movies such as:

Genre

Director

Actor 1, Actor 2, Actor 3

Rating

The dataset is cleaned by:

Removing missing values

Selecting required columns

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Steps Performed

Imported required libraries

Loaded the dataset

Cleaned and preprocessed the data

Converted categorical text data into numerical form using Label Encoding

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained the model using RandomForest Regressor

Evaluated the model using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R2 Score

Tested the model with sample input

🤖 Machine Learning Model Used

Random Forest Regressor

✅ Output

The model predicts the rating of a movie based on the given input features.

📌 Internship

This project is completed as Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at CodSoft.
