# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning classification system that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. The model classifies flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Iris Flower Dataset
- **File:** IRIS.csv
- **Features:**
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- **Target:** Species

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset from CSV file.
2. Performed data exploration and visualization.
3. Preprocessed the data (encoding, scaling).
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Trained a Machine Learning model using Logistic Regression.
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
7. Tested the model with custom input samples.

## 📈 Model Used
- Logistic Regression

## ✅ Results
- The model achieved high accuracy in classifying Iris flower species.
- It can correctly predict the species based on flower measurements.
