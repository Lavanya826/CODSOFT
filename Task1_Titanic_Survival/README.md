# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

This is a classic beginner-level data science and machine learning project that helps in understanding data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about passengers such as:

- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket number
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked port
- Survival status (Target variable)

Target Variable:
- `Survived`  
  - 0 = Did not survive  
  - 1 = Survived
